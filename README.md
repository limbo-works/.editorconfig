# .editorconfig

This repository is used to administer our `.editorconfig` file. New Visual Studio solutions/projects should use this file to ensure a uniform formatting across our projects.

## Have any suggestions?

If you have any suggestions for changes, feel free to either [create an issue](https://github.com/limbo-works/.editorconfig/issues/new) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/limbo-works/.editorconfig/compare) with the proposed changes. Than we can have a chat about it ;)
